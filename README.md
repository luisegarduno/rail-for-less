# Rail For Less

A fork of [rail-for-less](https://github.com/tikkisean/rail-for-less)

For instructions on how to run version 1, switch to branch "v1" (or click [here](https://github.com/luisegarduno/rail-for-less/tree/v1)). Still working on getting a couple of things working, as there are missing steps within the original "instructions".

This fork allows you to run the most recent version locally (as of 04/20/2024 ðŸ˜Ž). Currently still working out some issues though.

## Pre-requisites

* Node.js
* npm or yarn
